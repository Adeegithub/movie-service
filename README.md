This Project was done to gain hands-on experience on microservices architecture. The Movie Store consists of Two main services.
1. - Movie Service (This Repo)
2. - Order Service ([https://github.com/Adeegithub/order-service](url))


Movie Service: This service manages the movies (CRUD operations) and interacts with the My SQL Database to store or retrieve movie data.
